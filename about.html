                                The idea of ​​organizing a big music and dance festival was initiated by the trainers
                                and the management of the Foyer Culturale de Goma with the aim of promoting peace,
                                culture and peaceful coexistence in the region.
                                Young volunteers, trainers of the Goma cultural center all got together and decided to
                                make culture one of the means of expression, awareness, and promotion of peace. Name
                                given to the Amani Festival which means "Peace"

                        <p>
                            <span>
                                This idea was born following the success of the organization of the sanaa weekend which
                                is a space for discovery and promotion of young talents (musicians, actors, ...) from
                                Goma and artists trained in the Cultural Center.
                                Bringing back the big names in world music and the artists of the region will bring
                                together thousands of young people far from their daily lives and talk about the issue
                                of peace, of living together.
                                Without any experience or training in the organization of such a big event which brings
                                together more than 30,000 people, the trainers and young people of the Foyer decided to
                                give it a first try and make it a great success.
                                With the help of the Festival promoter and some Belgian friends experienced in the event
                                field, the 1st edition was decided for the end of August 2013. One year of work and
